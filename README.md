# BluetoothGame

An Android Game, Written in Kotlin, Using Bluetooth and the Accelerometer.

## About
This is a proof of concept I did in Kotlin on Android just to see if I could roll a ball around on a remote device over a bluetooth connection. The accelerometer data on phone A is sent to phone B over Bluetooth Classic and causes a game to roll around. Pretty crude, but it works.

## Future Work For the Hell of It
Whenever there's time I'll integrate some other sensors in, and some other phone functionality.
* Use the compass
* Add some gamification.
* Use BLE to detect the relative positions of the two devices and do something with that.
